  "In the fields of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, your models and  analyses will only be as good as the data behind them. Unfortunately, you will find that the majority of datasets you encounter will be filled with  missing, malformed, or erroneous data. Thankfully, Python provides a number  of handy libraries to help you clean and manipulate your data into a usable state. In today's lecture, we will leverage these Python libraries to turn a messy dataset into a gold mine of value!"
