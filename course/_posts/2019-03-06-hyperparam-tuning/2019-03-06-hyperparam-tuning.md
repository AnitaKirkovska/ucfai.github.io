  Some of the hardest aspects of Machine Learning are the details. Almost every algorithm we use is sensitive to "hyperparameters" which affect the initialization, optimization speed, and even the possibility of becoming accurate. We'll cover the general heuristics you can use to figure out what hyperparameters to use, how to  find the optimal ones, what you can do to make models more resilient, and the like. This workshop will be pretty "down-in-the-weeds" but will give you a better intuition about Machine Learning and its shortcomings.
